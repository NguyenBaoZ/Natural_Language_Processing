Kyle,31.08.2023,"Magnolia, TX",merrick_bank,5,Very easy to use to view statements and make online payments. Your representatives have been courteous and helpful when I have called with a problem. And when there have been questionable charges on my account I have been contacted immediately. I would definitely recommend Merrick Bank to other family members and friends!,
Julicia,23.08.2023,"Columbus, GA",merrick_bank,5,Merrick Bank has always been good to me for business. I can rely on Merrick Bank to make sure I have a great Banking experience. Merrick also rewards me with credit increases when they see that I have been credit responsible customer. I'm pleased with their service. I would recommend Merrick Bank to anyone who's also looking to build their credit.,
Karen,2.06.2023,"Marrero, LA",merrick_bank,4,"Times are tough for everyone and I have worked very hard to get my credit restored. Due to BOA antics I had to file for bankruptcy twice in 6 months and both times I asked to withdraw and the judge did so and recused both. However, I have written to bureaus several times for it to be removed from my file to no avail. Because of this I have a higher interest rate and I have to accept it until that is removed from my credit file. All in all, I am grateful for the credit line to rebuild my credit. I have always made payments on time and more than minimum due. Thank you.",3.0
Brent,29.03.2023,"Moultrie, GA",merrick_bank,5,"I can not asked for a better Credit Card Company, Merrick Bank has been the PERFECT situation for me and I am truly grateful to be a customer and to be a part of beautiful customer service that you give. I NEVER had to call to asked for a credit increase and anytime I had a problem with anything you guys ALWAYS took completely great care of me. I want to say thank you and keep up the wonderful work. I wished you had a bank that I could deposit money into because Merrick Bank would my personal bank and I will do ALL my transactions to you.",3.0
Sharon,23.11.2022,"Burnham, IL",merrick_bank,5,"Updated on 02/10/2023: I was happy to sign for a new credit card by Merrick to continue to grow my already good credit score of 730. Merrick sent the card, I used it and made my first payment right away. I used it the second time and wasn't aware when payment due dates. I noticed a huge drop in my score of 79 points, that was listed to Merrick said I had a late payment,...but I never received a payment due date. I immediately paid the balance of $190, called them and customer service rep. said my due date is the 9th every month. But it was listed Nowhere on the original paperwork I was sent with the credit card. I wrote a letter asking them to delete the late payment on my credit and I'm Still Waiting for that correction to my credit score!",3.0
Michelle,18.11.2022,"Frankston, TX",merrick_bank,4,"Overall I enjoy the card and use it over most of my other cards, my husband had one and I he was very happy with it. They always followed through with increases as mentioned when signing up or applying for card. He uses his quite often also. I applied and was approved and got my first increase like they said I would, I never miss a a payment and pay early but for whatever reason my increases stopped for no reason. I have waited thinking I was off on when I would get one but still nothing. Either way it's still a great card. I use it often. It offers cash back and is accepted anywhere I shop online or in store and it's secure. Have never once had hacking issue or fraud charges.",4.0
Meredith,30.09.2022,"Pinson, AL",merrick_bank,5,"What started out as a not so good experience turned out to be excellent. After about 4 tries to get a rep I finally got Omar. He is the epitome of what a customer service rep should be. He was courteous, knowledgeable, and helpful. Whomever the HR person that hired him take a bow and be on the hunt for more. Omar represents Merrick Bank well. He restored my confidence in your services. If I ever need customer service again, Omar is the only way that I would like to talk to, even though I know that will probably be an impossible task. Take a bow Omar, you are an original.",4.0
Darrell,6.09.2023,"Rocky Mount, NC",merrick_bank,5,Absolutely wonderful. Definitely recommend this card to anybody. Absolutely no issues with it and great service all over. Really glad I chose to get this card and hope to continue using it for a very long time. I have no complaints at all. You can use the card all over and it's widely accepted. It has nice designs and I've had no issues.,
Lisa,6.09.2023,"Bradley, FL",merrick_bank,5,"I have been a Merrick customer for about a decade now. There has never been a problem, dispute, or even a call to customer service. In this day and age, that is phenomenal. Truly happy with this company and have recommended them to many friends. Thank you for your continuing service.",
Frank,6.09.2023,"Berkeley, CA",merrick_bank,5,"I have only been with MB a short while, so my experience is limited. But everything is going seemingly well. The information I receive is timely and my card records are always up-to-date. I would recommend MB to friends, and I hope that we will enjoy a lifetime relationship. Thank you.",
Morgan,6.09.2023,"El Dorado, AR",merrick_bank,4,Haven’t been with you that long. So far so good. I guess it’s my fault for not reading over my agreement and accepting guidelines. So I think I was late on first payment. Which unfortunately I really could have used a higher credit limit. All in good time I guess.,
Nunzio,6.09.2023,"Springfield, MA",merrick_bank,3,"Satisfied with experience. I would like a greater credit line, considering the length of time I had the card, also, I believe that the annual fee should be removed. I like the credit card and continue to use it, but, the credit line leaves something to be desired. It would be nice to receive a credit line increase of $5,000.00 or more.",
Beverly,5.09.2023,"Georgetown, DE",merrick_bank,5,"I needed assistance freezing a misplaced card and the service advisor was super helpful. The service advisor also explained how to go into the account and remove the freeze when necessary so, I didn't need to call back. It was easy going back to unfreeze the card as well. The service provided was excellent.",
Nicolas,1.09.2023,"Mansfield, CT",merrick_bank,5,I have been very happy with Merrick Bank. I would recommend Merrick Bank to friends and family. I have not had to call for customer service or needed any help as the app is very clear and most of my questions I have had have been answered in the FAQ section.,
Edwin,1.09.2023,"Lyons, IN",merrick_bank,1,"When I called to find out what to do when I had charges on my bill that I didn’t make. I was angry, I was then transfer to an agent. I was put on hold and told to wait for the next available agent. It was 30 mins so I waited 35 mins. At that time I hung up without talking to anyone.",
Christopher,31.08.2023,"Williston, ND",merrick_bank,2,"Was promised double my credit amount. I’ve made on time payment. I requested an increase and got $200 increase. My limit was $600. Just false promise of the reason I signed up. I called about it and it’s because my autopay glitched and didn’t pull out of my account like it was supposed to. So I made on time payment for 6+months. And I got $200 increase, not the double. It’s just poor experience especially when I’ve paid on time and have used the card. Also you would NOT get rid of the late payment. Even though it was an issue with your system.",
Raymond,30.08.2023,"Greenwood, IN",merrick_bank,4,The relationship between myself and the company is still new. Decent start to the credit line and I will patiently wait for the credit line to be doubled within 1 year per the agreement. If that does happen I will keep my end of the deal and make all payments on time and promote the company with even more positive reviews.,
Aaron,30.08.2023,"Saratoga Springs, UT",merrick_bank,5,Merrick is very transparent about your credit and billing and also offers solid advice on rebuilding your credit. The interest rate for me wad fair and they even tell you about keeping your spending on the card under 30 percent to help with your credit. I highly recommend merrick bank to anyone looking for a good credit card which also rewards you for paying on time.,
Jamaal,30.08.2023,"Edison, NJ",merrick_bank,5,Their app is very easy to use and comes with a free fico score review every month. Talking to their customer service is also usually very easy. You can apply for a credit increase every 6 months. If you're on time with your payments they may increase your credit line automatically within that period.,
Coral,30.08.2023,"Arlington, TX",merrick_bank,5,Very helpful personnel on phone and in person. Love I can transfer money to family with a couple clicks. I appreciate the ability to make an appointment if need be and not wait for a opening to discuss account. I also like how close it is if I need to talk or do business.,
Joyce,30.08.2023,"Bethel, CT",merrick_bank,5,"From the beginning I've had a good response from them. My initial card was approved quickly and sent quickly. Just recently, they reported to me charges that were suspicious. They weren't mine so they quickly restored them and VERY quickly, I got my new card. I'm happy with them. This is me, no incentives to write it.",
Mark,30.08.2023,"Lawrenceville, GA",merrick_bank,4,Had a few fraudulent charges appear and they handled it immediately. Thanks. Canceled my card and sent a new one that I received in 5 days. Overall in the past 5 years I've received plenty of help when needed. I changed address recently and it was handled by a well spoken professional person. Again thank you.,
Shirnale,24.08.2023,"Rocky Mount, NC",merrick_bank,5,The website is very easy to use and easy to find what you are looking for whether it be to enroll in paperless billing or make a payment. The payment process is very easy and quick and it is painless to update payment information if changing a bank or using a new checking or savings account.,
Cleo,23.08.2023,"Charlotte, NC",merrick_bank,5,Very wonderful experience since I've been a member. Keep up the great job. I've shared my experience and referred several people to the bank. My customer support experience is just as great each time I have called which makes things a lot easy to enjoy.,
Scott,23.08.2023,"Cornwall On Hudson, NY",merrick_bank,4,"Merrick Bank card has been good for me. I get periodic increases due to my pay history and great standing. The app is helpful and easy to use. I have only two concerns / complaints. 1. My card is broken and the app will not let me order a replacement one. 2. When I call the 800#, it does not give me an option to speak with anyone. Have NEVER been able to get ahold of a live person.",
Sue,23.08.2023,"Redondo Beach, CA",merrick_bank,5,Merrick was the first bank that allowed me the chance to rebuild my credit after an unfortunate business bankruptcy. They even raised my credit limit because I've kept my payments on time. The only thing I'm sad about is that they changed the Visa to Mastercard. I'm very grateful to Merrick Bank.,
Julie,23.08.2023,"Smyrna, DE",merrick_bank,1,Every time I try to make a payment with my card it takes the money out then puts it right back into my account and shows that I haven't paid. I make my payments early every month and it doesn't show that I make any with your company! I don't like that especially because it brings my credit score down.,
Gary,21.08.2023,"Urbana, IL",merrick_bank,2,I like the ease of how my bill has been easy to pay online and I appreciate the credit line increases. But what I HATE is dealing with overseas call centers for customer service. I don't understand how you guys cannot use US BASED call centers because when I first started with you guys that's who I talk to but then they told me that you guys opened up overseas call centers instead as an option which should have never been done-- I don't understand them and it frustrates me when the US BASED call center worked great before and made your company stand it and I told my friends about your card during that time but since then I have that bad decision to open up foreign base call centers I have not mentioned your card to anyone.,
Kyriaki,16.08.2023,"Mount Pocono, PA",merrick_bank,5,"It has been an absolute pleasure to have this card! When things went sour in my life the representative was there to assist and find me a solution!!! You are the BEST!! I appreciate the limit increase as well!! The representatives are very welcoming. Professional, courteous and understanding! I sure am Happy I have them by my side.",
Shawn,6.08.2023,"Punxsutawney, PA",merrick_bank,5,Been very happy with this card from the day I got it until now. So keep up the good team work. Plus if any friends all about wanting a good credit card I will tell them right away about the card I have now. And all the features you can get out rewards you can earn by using the credit card.,
James,5.08.2023,"Hayward, CA",merrick_bank,5,Very pleased with Merrick Bank MasterCard. I'm kept posted to my phone on my balance. I get my statements on time by email and to my phone. When I disputed charges to my card it was handled in a professional manner. My card was canceled at that time and a new one was shipped to me in a timely manner.,
Sherri,4.08.2023,"North Port, FL",merrick_bank,5,Very pleased with my Merrick Bank Card. Just wished the interest rates were a bit lower with the way the inflation is. Would recommend this card to anyone looking for a good card to help them through these tough times and the future. Automated system is easy to navigate through. Customer Service is AMAZING also..,
Kama,4.08.2023,"Kingston, WA",merrick_bank,5,"I have never had any issues with this card, they have done everything they claimed they would do which was raise my credit score and increase my credit limit with time. I have recently been talking to my daughter about getting this as well as soon as I figure out how.",
Chuck,4.08.2023,"York, PA",merrick_bank,4,"Merrick helped me with my credit score and also didn't take forever, like other credit card companies to increase my credit line. I would recommend this company to my friends and family. If anyone does acquire a card I would suggest downloading the Merrick app. It's convenient and easy to use to make payments.",
Jean,4.08.2023,"Beaverton, OR",merrick_bank,5,You guys are great. I went to a donut place and was overcharged and my donuts were horrible and after many attempts at trying to get my money refunded from the store and being hung up on by the manager I was frustrated and thought I was gonna take a loss but thanks to your helpful customer service my money was credited back quickly to my account. I will not only continue to keep my card with you but I will recommend you to friends and family.,
Brenton,4.08.2023,"Verona, PA",merrick_bank,5,"Easy to use and great customer service. Can look at FICO SCORE and the app is super easy with a quick glance option to enable to see your availability, amount spent and total limit. Information is secure, and low APR/ interest on transactions. Never had an issue with the card! I would recommend to anyone to get this card!",
Mona,4.08.2023,"Ojai, CA",merrick_bank,5,"I might not recommend to friends because they can get lower interest rates and I cannot. So maybe if the right person came along. I took this card because you let me. At a significantly higher interest rate. But as far as service, it's been very nice. I'm very glad to have this card.",
Stephanie,4.08.2023,"Walla Walla, WA",merrick_bank,4,"I am fairly happy with Merrick Bank, great customer service, always super helpful when I need to contact a consumer representative. My only wish is there was a faster way to increase my credit line, like an auto 3 to 6 month increase or a way to increase our levels to bypass the monthly service fees, these can be quite annoying when you pay your card off and then get another bill for $4.00.",
Rhonda,4.08.2023,"Quincy, MA",merrick_bank,5,I've only been a customer of Merrick for 2 months so far and I've had zero issues. I'd definitely recommend to a friend. It's even no hassle to pay the bill. So many places don't accept prepaid debit cards to pay bills but Merrick Bank does as some of us do not have regular bank accounts. It makes it so convenient.,
Tonya,4.08.2023,"Cleveland, OH",merrick_bank,1,"I’ve had Merrick for about 5 years, for the last year my card had a block on it due to suspicious activity. I was working 80+ hours a week due to staffing issues around this time and wasn’t able to get the information together that they needed. About a month ago I was able to call them, get them the information and they unblocked my account. Today I received a letter stating they closed my account due to inactivity and it was not allowed to be reopened. I had no balance on it, I was never late with my payment up until it was blocked I used it regularly and that’s how they treated me (they didn’t even give me a warning that it would be closed). When I called, I was treated like I was this horrible person. I won’t use this bank again! I honestly have better credit cards than Merrick Bank, it’s just the point that this is how they treat their customers that pay on time.",
1042,3.08.2023,"Palm City, FL",merrick_bank,1,I've been a customer for more than 7 years with this company. I received a letter yesterday stating that my account had been canceled due to no activity. This was done with no warning whatsoever and will have a negative affect on my credit rating I currently have good credit. I called the representative with absolutely no help from him and he agreed that they should send out warning letters that your account will be in risk of being canceled if you did not use your card. I've never had this happen in 40 years of having credit and credit cards from other companies. Everyone needs to be aware of hidden policies that these companies have.,
Barton,28.07.2023,"Alamo, CA",merrick_bank,2,Wait times for customer service can be extraordinary long and unreasonable. Fraud department needs to transfer you back to customer service to finalize a report and you may not get through. No access from abroad to app or desktop site. Just doesn't ever load.,
Sandra,27.07.2023,"Gainesville, FL",merrick_bank,3,"In the month of May, a credit card was sent, but I never received it. I requested another, which I got in July. When I tried to use it, I found out it was blocked. After complaining about that, I was told I had an outstanding balance. How can that be?",
Sherrie,26.07.2023,"Harrison, OH",merrick_bank,5,"I find working with with them very easy. They're always very informative and pleasant to speak to. Yes, I would recommend to friends and family!

Ernestine,26.07.2023,"Sunbury, NC",merrick_bank,5,In my experience with Merrick Bank during the time that I have been a customer I've gotten nothing but great service. The way I've handled my business has continually been rewarded and I'm very satisfied. I've not had any type of problem that I can think of.. All I can really say is that it's a great card to have in your wallet. My husband also enjoys the benefits of his. I'm not sure what else I can say except thanks for the opportunity you have given us both.,
Jacqueline,26.07.2023,"Memphis, TN",merrick_bank,5,"Would definitely recommend Merrick Bank.

Dhane,26.07.2023,"Spanaway, WA",merrick_bank,5,"Been a great card so far, trying to get my score back up to snuff, Merrick Bank approved me when others would not, I use the card when I need to and pay it off asap, it’s been great to have it when I need it. Can’t wait until my limit goes up so I can use it for larger purchases.",
Robert,24.07.2023,"Avon Lake, OH",merrick_bank,5,To this point I have had nothing but good experiences in my dealings with Merrick Bank. I have a credit card through them and have had nothing unexpected present itself. Based on my interactions I would feel comfortable in recommending Merrick to others. Transactions are seamless and their app is easy to use while being convenient.,
Pamela,23.07.2023,"Port Leyden, NY",merrick_bank,5,"I’m very happy with Merrick. I would recommend this card to all friends and family. Thank you for doing business with me.

John,22.07.2023,"Barnesville, PA",merrick_bank,4,"The online process is great! The problem I have is the card is not recognized when paying at the pumps for gas.

Beverley,22.07.2023,"Chicago, IL",merrick_bank,5,It is a good card to have in your wallet and I never had any problems using the card. The card is a great card to use anywhere in the us and out the country. I don't leave home without this card at anytime. Good card to have in your possession.,
Deborah,22.07.2023,"Alvin, TX",merrick_bank,5,"I wish there was a limit increase button on the website. My husband has his card nearly two years and has never had a limit increase.

Charlotte,21.07.2023,"Waveland, MS",merrick_bank,5,"I am very pleased with Merrick Bank and the ease of navigating through my account on line. I am pleased to recommend Merrick Bank to anyone asking about my experience. Merrick was the first company to help me rebuild my credit with a starter $300 account.

Thank you Merrick Bank for being my financial partner.,
Michael,13.07.2023,"Fort Lee, NJ",merrick_bank,2,"This can't happened to a customer. I spoke to a representative customer service a few days ago. I think it was the 7 or the 8 of July try to fix the problem about fraud in my account, I told him it wasn't me who did this transactions for $39.99 and $12.99 and the last one for $39.99 again. I think it was a Fraud department Representative and he transfer me to a new card department and that's when the nightmare started and I was waiting forever. Nobody pickup the phone for an hour and then somebody pick up the phone and I said hello and then they hang up the phone on me. I felt insulted by a Merrick Bank representative. Now I need a new credit as soon as possible. It should be more representatives working in that department. And that's the reason the I am unhappy with Merrick Bank, please kindly send me a new credit card, any question call at my cell #** or email me at **.",
Allen,12.07.2023,"Hobart, IN",merrick_bank,5,I was happy when I signed up. I use your card often and I'm very happy with it.

Woodie,12.07.2023,"Mobile, AL",merrick_bank,3,"When I accepted your card, I did so thinking that I would get a decent credit line increase, if I paid in a timely manner. Keeping my balance at 30% doesn't allow me to do much of anything when I'm traveling. If I had to do it all over again, I would not have accepted your pre approval..",
Darren,12.07.2023,"Wichita, KS",merrick_bank,2,"It takes several days to get a notification that my card has been used for a purchase. I have other credit cards with other banks and I get notifications in a few seconds after I make a purchase. When it takes days to get notification from Merrick Bank I have to think to myself, did I make that purchase or does someone have my account info and making unauthorized purchases. So if Merrick Bank could speed up how long it takes to get notification of each purchase that would make me give a 5 star.",
Ricardo,12.07.2023,"Tucson, AZ",merrick_bank,5,"Easy card to get, although expensive. I would suggest you offer incentives to those who pay on time, like annual fee waiver, you are already getting an incredibly high interest rate, perhaps those who pay on time, get a rate reduction as an incentive to stay on target, the credit bureaus are not so generous.",
Melissa,12.07.2023,"West Seneca, NY",merrick_bank,4,"I actually really like my Merrick Bank Card. I like the fact that I can see my credit score and review ways to improve it. But if I could add something to make it a 5 star rating, it would definitely be to add some type of rewards program to the account. This would give me the incentive to use it more. Everything else is great.",
Rino,12.07.2023,"Newbury, OH",merrick_bank,3,High interest rates. Yearly fees don't help. Hard to pay down. Interest rates never gone down and never missed a payment but yet Interest always stays high. Will be trying to get it paid this yr and move on. The yearly fee is a pain. You would think it would be dropped but it doesn't look like it will ever be.,
Elaine,12.07.2023,"Whitman, MA",merrick_bank,5,Merrick Bank is the best bank ever. They gave me credit when most wouldn't.

I think this bank deserves 10.,
Rita,12.07.2023,"Douglasville, GA",merrick_bank,1,A complete nuisance with all your ads just to try to pay my bill. I was on the phone for over 30 minutes just trying to pay my bill.

Karen,28.10.2022,"Camden, SC",merrick_bank,1,I recently opened a credit card account with Merrick Bank. I was never informed that I would be sent a pin to use the first time.

She also could not understand that a pin was not mailed to me. I ask her to set my pin after she verified it was me by asking numerous questions. I answered them all. She stated all she could do was send out my pin again. I should receive it in 7 - 10 days. She never offered any other options or tried to get a supervisor to help her to see if the issue could be resolved while I was on the phone. At this point I have already had my card for 4 weeks.

Agent put me on hold for a bit and came back and told me they would send it out today, expedited, and waive the fee. Great! Asked for a tracking number and put on hold, call unfortunately disconnects.",
Yvette,10.05.2022,"Battletown, KY",merrick_bank,3,I like the credit card and had no bad experience until I decided to pay my payment earlier than the due date. I decided to pay my bill on the 1st thinking I would get it over with so I wouldn't have to worry later. Well they ended up on the following month saying that I never paid. I called and was told that because I paid on the 1st it was put on the previous month as I paid 2 times for that month. I was so livid because I was never told in any of the paperwork that you would be penalized for paying early. Which the lady I was connected to also stated how it's not my fault because they don't tell anyone. But yet I still have to pay twice the payment amount they had me pay a payment and added another at the end of the month. Which makes it 2 payments I have to pay and was not told that during the conversation on the phone. I had to find out when I looked on my statement. Lesson learned. I will not pay any of my credit card bills early again.,
Desiree,7.05.2022,"Greybull, WY",merrick_bank,5,Great communication via email. They offer autopay which is awesome. You don’t have to request a credit limit increase as they periodically check your eligibility and give you one if you meet their standards financially. They don’t have any monthly fees unlike this First Premier card I had that would charge $6 a month even with a $0 balance.,
Polly,6.05.2022,"Middletown, DE",merrick_bank,5,I love this credit card. They are very helpful when you have questions and up your spending limit when you are keeping your account in good standing.

Terri,6.05.2022,"Philadelphia, PA",merrick_bank,5,"I found my experience with Merrick Bank satisfying, because it has given me an opportunity to reestablish my creditworthiness among other things. Merrick Bank offered me a generous line of credit to start, a chance to maintain the ability to use the Merrick VISA credit card in a responsible manner, and all the while help me increase my overall credit scores. I was then able to rebuild my credit, showing that I was deserving of the chance, and I went on to establish a good relationship with a creditor. Thank-You Merrick Bank! Ms. Terri",3.0

I currently have zero balance, but my credit usage has not been updated with the credit bureaus!

Only other business conducted has been my usual monthly payment activity. All this said, I certainly appreciated the unexpected limit increase and I always have a painless monthly payment experience. * I REALLY appreciate a very realistic and reasonable cutoff time. Some cards have a cutoff time which is actually early in the day of the date due, especially when time zones are taken into account. Seems somewhat unfair for your payment to be required made by 4pm of the date due, when it should realistically be midnight. Oh well, not Merrick. Live and learn AND read the fine print. Thank you!!",11.0

I just know I owe it and have bank send in. This one day I looked and I had paid, over 300.00 in interest in 7 months and highest balance owed was 2500.00 of that. I am working on paying them off.

Merrick was the first credit card company that seemed to look fairly legitimate so I applied and was accepted for a modest credit line. I put the card to use right away with small purchases which I paid off each month and after a year or so they increased my credit line automatically. Later I had some emergency expenses that came up so I carried a balance for awhile but paid it off after about six months. The interest rate I paid was fairly high, but I figured that's what you expect from a starter credit card. I like the online account and payment system which seems to work well.

I have been with them for over a year and called about questions several times. None of the question were about my bill. But about some of their policies and a few other issues. The answers were addressed promptly, clearly, and to the point. In my opinion, if I do not have to call, email, or contact Merrick Bank in any way they are conducting business in the most professionals and proper manner way possible. I am very satisfied with Merrick Bank. No one deserves a 5-star rating. No one is perfect.",2.0
Valerie,22.10.2019,"Los Angeles, CA",merrick_bank,5,I think this is one of the most fair credit card companies out there.

Talking with the representative on the phone I was told not to worry about this and this will be taken off my account. I was a bit taken back by this statement but thought what the heck they know more than I do even though when i had issues like this many years before with America express they had opened a dispute and sent me documentation on that dispute with full updates, in this case Merrick bank had not sent me one piece of document confirming an ongoing dispute or investigation.

Charles,14.08.2019,"Largo, FL",merrick_bank,3,"Merrick Bank has been fair and easy to work with as a credit card provider.

They increase the credit line based on payment history and amounts - I pay much more than the minimum each month and they have increased my credit limit 3 or 4 times since I have had the account. The only drawback is that they have restrictions in place that may be detrimental to the average consumer - it takes a week to post payment and regain the amount on your credit line, but if you need it quicker they will do that - for a fee.",4.0

After several calls, they figured out and admitted that there was an error made by their app that made my bank account show as all zeros. Even after we found out what the issue was and that it was an error on there, they still refused to fix the negative reporting to my credit. On top of that, I spoke to 5 different people and finally someone told me that they would remove a late fee charge AND a NSF charge due to the error on the app. I told her I wanted to speak to someone about getting the negative reporting off my credit. To which she said ""My shift is over and I can't wait for a supervisor so I'll transfer you to an answering service.""

There was no warning that if I did not use the account within a 365 day period that it would be cancelled. This is something I have never heard of before.

Alex,30.01.2019,"Ormond Beach, FL",merrick_bank,5,I would gladly recommend Merrick Bank. I have never had any issue's using my card both domestically and internationally. Customer service is Friendly and helpful. They give periodic credit line increases (wish you could request) however they do offer them frequently. They offered me credit when I was rebuilding my score and helped me towards achieving the credit score I have today. The credit lines they offer are decent to start. Having a account with Merrick Bank get's you access to your fico score monthly and as I stated friendly customer service. I am happy I accepted the invitation to apply and have not one negative thing to say towards Merrick Bank. If you are looking for a credit card either secured or unsecured I recommend Merrick bank.

Marilyn,29.01.2019,"Hermitage, TN",merrick_bank,1,I had a Merrick Bank card a few years ago. They raised my Credit limit & all was fine until there were some charges that were not mine & when I disputed them they wouldn't remove them. Long story short I stopped paying. It got so bad. Last year I got a letter from a collections company that offered a settlement for a much lesser amount. I paid it & received a letter from an attorney stating the account was 'paid in full.' That was last April. Today I got a 1099-C from Merrick Bank for the amount of $1423.00 charge off! I assume they are sending this for me to file on my 2018 taxes as income. This said 'charge off' but my paid off letter from an attorney said 'paid in full' even though it was a lesser amount. It was a 'settlement'. I am perplexed & rather upset. Calling the attorney tomorrow. Just thought this information might be helpful for other consumers who have been burnt by Merrick Bank.,16.0

All of the card companies receive and process our payments THE SAME DAY. Your bank is the only one that receives the payment, then waits several days to post it to our account. This results in late charges which are not legitimate and unscrupulous. Why can't your bank post the payment the same day it is received? This is a major problem. And it prevents us from utilizing Merrick Bank services on a greater scale.

However I don't like the practice of having to wait an entire week after payment has left my bank account for the available credit to be applied to my account for use. The payment system is still very dinosaur compared to Capital One that allows debit card payments that charge instantly and fully process within 2 days. This is the biggest reason why in the future Merrick will be paid off and left in the shoe box. It just takes too much time and hassle to try to pay you guys, as money does not just sit in my account for days on end.",20.0

I love my Merrick card but they are missing out on large profits as I am forced to use my other cards. I will provide a copy of my bank statement if it will get me a credit line increase.

Aug 14th I lost sight in my left eye... and have now gone to 4 eye doctors in an attempt to find the problem. Now I understand that is not your problem.  But just wanted to explain, I am short on cash. I had set up auto payment, but had to cancel because I didnt have the funds. I called to see if I could set up auto pmt for 10-4-18 for $100 to avoid a late payment penalty, but was told they dont do that. So... my payment is late and I HATE that.

That made me feel like I was worthy again for credit! I accepted, and in the 3 yrs we have had the card, our credit rating has increased as has our credit limit.

Merrick Bank will do neither as they do not allow customers to ask for an increase and they will never lower an existing APR according to the supervisor.

Lately they have restricted my account for access for various reasons. The first time was that they felt that the merchant I was dealing with was a fraud. Note he is a good friend and never took advantage of anybody and has a good reputation. The last time was because I paid off my balance in full from my checking account. Yes that's right. I even put them on speaker phone so a friend could hear them and know I wasn't making this up. Merrick Bank accused me of using someone else's money. They even made me go to my checking account bank and have that bank send them a fax to assure them that I had the authority to pay my bills. Really? I have to prove I can pay my bills? My wife just died and I have some money from insurance payments. Really? Froze my account because I have to prove I can pay. ,40.0
Gerald,10.06.2018,"Tucson, AZ",merrick_bank,1,I received an offer and accepted it. I got my card and started to use it. Sometime in 2014 Merrick decided to close my account and also my internet ability. The last payment I made was in June 2016 and I never received another statement from them. I think the balance due at that time was less than $100.00. I recently received a letter from a collection agency that said I still owed Merrick a little over $400.00. Having received no new statements from Merrick I have made no additional payments since my June 2016 payment. Because they have not sent me any statements and because I have not made any additional payments they have probably be accumulating late fees and interest charges on the late fees. I am going to try and call customer service and write a letter to the collection agency with a copy to Merrick and see what happens.,33.0

Part of their plan was to increase my line of credit after six months of on-time payments. I made sure my payments were made on time and right about the sixth month they increased my line of credit without me having to ask for a review. A couple of competitors also offered the same but failed to review my performance. When I called to ask, they said they didn't do that and I could request a line increase with a fee.

Francine,20.02.2018,"East Pembroke, MA",merrick_bank,1,"I have been a customer of Merrick Bank since 2012 . Never late with payments. In November, 2017 one of my other credit cards was hack into First Saving. The hackers got into my checking accounts and changed my address to Miami, FLA. Our money was not available. This was a mess. My husband and I live on his social security. For December payment I stop recurring payments because of this. I made my payment 5 days after due date. The csr waived late fee and said, ""Don't worry. It all good."" The next month MB proceeded to take 92.00 out of my account instead of the 39.00 which was never mentioned to me when I called the bank to let them know what was going on. I did not plan for this amount and I keep exact amount in my checking account because of being hack into. That checking account is now closed because of the hackers. ",31.0
John,17.02.2018,"Summerville, SC",merrick_bank,5,"I'm in the middle to repairing my credit and was only getting offers for secured cards, or $300 limit cards. Merrick just offered $750 which I consider pretty good for my credit score. It comes with an offer to double that limit to $1,500 after 7 months. I don't carry any balances on my cards - pay off the entire balance when the bill comes due, so this will be a very welcomed $1,500 credit card in 7 months. Not bad.

Anna,13.10.2017,"Miami, FL",merrick_bank,5,Merrick Bank was the first bank to give me a chance to rebuild my credit. I have nothing but positive things to say about them.

steve,12.10.2017,"Greenbelt, MD",merrick_bank,1,"I got my monthly statement and found a 38.00 late. My bill is due by the 27th and I paid that bill at 5:53 Eastern Standard Time. Technically it should have been credited on time. My bank shows paid, but they are claiming it wasn't credited until the 28th. My bank statement also shows it actually wasn't received until the 29th. Spoke with customer service and they say, it wasn't paid until the 28th, so you know. You gotta pay us. I've caught them in a lie, T-Mobile shows phone contact with them on the 27th at 5:53 pm.

Tanya,11.10.2017,"North Babylon, NY",merrick_bank,1,I've been a member since May 2008 - nine years. I've never been over 60 days late on payment yet Merrick has been reporting negatively on my credit report. I requested that my credit limit be increased and the rep read off some nonsense that customers cannot request a credit increase; that Merrick periodically reviews accounts for increases. Well... it's been 9 years... No increase. My guess? They've been erroneously reporting my account as negative so they automatically passed me over for an increase without confirming whether the account is really a negative one. I hate them. I am closing my account as soon as they fix the drama on my credit report. BTW I've already contacted all three bureaus and launched an investigation. Merrick is a waste of my time and money. I want a credit card that actually has perks and doesn't make 9 years of mistakes in reporting customers' accounts. They have been doing me dirty for years and I'm sick of them.,31.0

Keith,24.09.2017,"Kissee Mills, MO",merrick_bank,1,I'm on SS and get paid on 3rd of each month. I send out check on 1st or 2nd with all my other bills. Other creditors post payments no later than 8th. Why you don't post till 20 something is just a way to charge more interest. I know I'm only 1 little account but if you do this to all your customers 1 or 2 cent times the millions of customers is a LOT OF FREE MONEY. I'm not late on my payments. Last month I made elec. payment so not to give you more than was due by your representatives dragging their feet posting payments. I know that I'm not the only one you’re doing this to so clean up your act.,43.0
Richard,24.09.2017,"Las Vegas, NV",merrick_bank,1,I will never use my Merrick Bank credit card again. I've never disputed a charge before and the one time that I did Merrick Bank made me jump through so many hoops to dispute the transaction and never refunded the money after telling me they were going to. Instead they mailed me a letter asking for the same information I had already given them twice already and they said that if I did not respond by a certain date that they will assume the merchant has taken care of the issue. The problem is by then the time frame had already gone and passed by the time I received their letter in the mail. This is a very low-end credit card and only good for beginners trying to build credit. Definitely not a credit card to be using once you are established.,26.0
Keisha,23.09.2017,"Union, NJ",merrick_bank,4,"So far, so good. Merrick Bank has held up their end of the contract and has done what they said they will do.

The interest rate is a little higher but that's to be expected. This is a rebuilder credit card. I have not had any problems with the use or in payments posting so far.

And they said, ""Your payment shows pending to be pulled out on the following months due date."" I told them, ""No. I had made on the due date and the phone system said payment has been processed.""

Peter,6.08.2017,"Westfield, MA",merrick_bank,1,"I had my Merrick Bank card for several years. I was unhappy with the very high-interest rate, but I paid the card off three years ago and just kept it on hand for emergencies. Then the Merrick Ripoff started. I had never been so much as a day late with a single payment, and I paid off my Merrick VISA card balance way early. Then, when a relative had an emergency I let her charge $1800 on my Merrick card and she agreed to make the payments. She has done this, and still never a late payment on the card. And yet, for some unfathomable reason other than corporate greed, out of the clear blue Merrick Bank sent me a notice that they were jacking up my APR to 28.45% (and 33.45% for cash advances). This is in addition to a flat $4.00/month that they charge for, I don't know, the privilege of letting them screw me over with ridiculously high-interest rates?

They also gave my account credit increases upon their review of my account. Also when my bank stopped a payment by error they didn't charge me a late fee or raise my interest fee.

I think an upgrade would be beneficial to both the bank and the consumer, also, offering 2 factor authentication would provide another layer of security.",10.0

As I paid timely, my credit limit also increased automatically. Now that my credit score has risen significantly, I am considering closing this account. These are the reasons why: 1) the annual fee of $60, 2) the monthly fee of $5, 3) the time it takes to process my payment to the card that is over $500. Another reason which is not a make it or break it reason is that the website is not up to par with other banks.

However, I recently found out that HSBC reported a late payment on my credit reports. This late payment (August 2018) was the result of the technical glitch of the EZ Pay System. I hope you can help me remove this late payment mark on my credit reports. Here’s what happened: When I volunteered in Egypt last summer (May-Sept 2018), I applied for a HSBC credit card because of its presence in Egypt and beyond. Before I volunteered in Egypt, I called HSBC to place a travel alert and inquire about steps I need to take to set up automatic payments. I was worried because I might not have access to internet.

The thing is they were blaming each other for the account not being opened, after about 3-weeks of opening the account, they still not know what was taking so long.

The bank is very slow and costly for transfers to other my other accounts, PayPal & Charles Schwab. If you want a next day transfer from a BB&T account it is a $10 cost. The basic transfer charge is $3 and that can take as long a 5 working days and if it falls on a weekend it is longer. Recently, I have noticed, I am not seeing debit transactions for several Days. They are holding on to our money as long as they can and I am paying extra for them to do it. This may be how most Commercial Banks are operating. However, PayPal charges for transfers, but it is a tiny percentage of the transfer, free if you want to wait a couple of days. At my other institutions I see my transactions instantaneously. I think we all expect that. There are better options out there. Stay away from BB&T.",13.0

You can imagine the billions they make from the poor every year from such exorbitant fees and the regulators of the industry allows them to carry on with this theft of depositors money.

This one is the worst. They do not properly pre-qualify buyers, employees rarely answer their phones, horrible follow-up and ultimate lack of performance will cause your transaction to fail, at your expense. Stay Away!!!

L.,23.10.2018,"Austell, GA",bbt_bank,1,I never write reviews but BB&T is the worst bank ever. Please do not bank with BB&T. This is a fraud banking company. They charged me $72 for being overdrafted $23. They claim they can only waive one fee every two years. There were fraudulent charges on my account and they allowed the charges to go through even though my account was already in the negative and charges me a $144 overdrafted fee and I had to wait until charges clear to be refunded. They then declined my dispute and refuse to give me my money back. Took two months to be refunded. If your account is $75 overdrafted they will not allow any charges to be made on the account but if it’s $100 or more overdrafted they allow charges to go through on your account to charge more overdrafted fees. This bank is terrible and the customer service sucks. I will be leaving BB&T I have never experienced the amount of disappointment with a bank that I have with BB&T.,22.0
William,23.10.2018,"Crittenden, KY",bbt_bank,1,BB&T has shut down my card every time I've turned around. Last night after running out of gas on I 75 I walked to gas station to get gas. You needed cash for deposit to get gas can! So I went to ATM my card won't work. I walked to a BB&T bank there ATM rejects card. After calling the bank no answers or can't help is all I got. I ended up sleeping if you can call it that in my car on a 38 degree night Just to wake go to work by foot. Call BB&T 3 banks could not understand the code used to turn off card was no help. I called complaint department was told they would file a form and someone would call within 8 days lol. One more don't plan on using online banking if you’re thinking of using BB&T. It's never correct changes your balance even when nothing has gone thru account and it goes offline all the time. And if you call complaint department you cannot get a number for corporate office.

However, I also had another sum of money that was being put in, but was still processing.

Always have several bank accounts at different banks so you can easily switch. Most people stay with the same bank because it is difficult to switch if you have all ""your eggs in one basket"". Your most powerful weapon is having a diversity of banks so you can move. Also send letters and complaints to their managers, especially when they fail to get back to you.

I’m not understanding cause I’ve banked with Chase and BofA and have never had this many issues with overdraft fees and transaction being there and then not there and then reappearing.

They also hold ""Previous Day overdraft fee"" for weeks! When you call to complain they give you the classic ""well you should have a ledger and keep track of your account"".

They do everything they can to make sure the debit comes out causing fees before a credit is put in. They do not care that their poor business practices are hurting their customers.

The charge for this payment was pending and I have asked the online vendor to reverse the charge, but I took the cash to the bank to make sure it was covered just in case. The charge is still pending but I am being charged $36 for an overdraft charge. When I called to ask why they advised that the pending charge, caused a charge that cleared to be insufficient. ",8.0

Kelly,4.06.2017,"Ocala, FL",bbt_bank,1,BB&T makes a practice of calculating debits before deposits to illegally incur excessive overdraft charges. This happened to my boyfriend but not to my account because I did not opt-in for overdraft protection. None of my deposits ever went into pending status because I did not opt-in. That is how you avoid their nightmare theft period. If you have overdraft protection any deposits that you make whether you make them cash or checks will all be considered mixed deposits allowing them to be put in pending status for average of three or four days which means that anything that comes through as a debit will probably overdraft and incur an overdraft fee of $36 each. So by the time your deposits are factored in you will be significantly in the hole. ,10.0

In September of this year I had made a couple debit card purchases on the first of the month. They claim it took nine days for these purchases to clear my account (even though on the app I can clearly see that these transactions were already taken out of the account) and then proceeded to charge me with five overdraft fees for very small purchases under $15 a piece. It seems to me they wait until your account balance is low or overdrafts a few dollars and then they let these so-called pending charges go through your account. These are debit card transactions with are instantaneously authorized and should not take nine days to post to your account.,3.0
Lauren,14.09.2021,"Boulder, CO",compass_bank,1,"I will NEVER do business with BBVA again. I had a large balance during the pandemic. I recently paid it off with a $10K payment on July 26th, sent electronically, which took into account several days of interest in the transit time. The payment left my bank the following day, but BBVA put a hold on that payment ON THEIR END and didn't post it on my account until August 10th. During that time, the account racked up another $106 in interest. I called, they said they'd check into it and call back in 4 days. I waited two weeks - no call. I called back. Not only do they refuse to removed the additional interest from their holding my payment, it had accumulated more interest. Such a lack of integrity. I will do all I can to persuade people not to support this ** enterprise.",5.0
Yulya,2.09.2021,"Jesup, GA",compass_bank,1,I have never seen a more incompetent bank. It is impossible to just make an online payment.

BBVA randomly took over, so thought I would give them a chance since they were the parent bank and since I loved Simple. Since then, I've had continuous issues with my actual account, randomly charged overdraft fees when I do not have negative balance (OD protection as added just in case). Was told I had to go to the physical bank to add banking features to my account (banks are open same hours I work, so can only go during lunch), wasted my time going to the physical bank as I waited the entire lunch break and was not able to be helped.

Allison,30.07.2021,"Denver, CO",compass_bank,1,"I was originally a Simple customer that was transferred to BBVA when they were bought out. The fees at BBVA were ridiculous right off the bat (one example: there's a $6/month fee if you don't manually turn off paper statements) so I quickly decided to move to a new bank. Turns out, canceling a BBVA bank account within the first 6 months results in yet another fee (!) so I decided to leave the account open until the 6 months were up and just disable my debit cards to keep anything from accidentally getting charged to the account. That was very naïve of me. ",3.0

This obviously was not going to work. I asked to speak to a supervisor and after 5 minutes was transferred to Rene' who would not provide his last name. He confirmed the limitation and since there is no local branch in Nevada, suggested I drive to Arizona from Las Vegas in order to process the wire transfer on Monday since their banks are closed on Saturdays.

Richard,24.07.2021,"Silverdale, WA",compass_bank,1,"I was a Simple Bank member, who was bought and subsequently shut down by BBVA USA. After realizing it was too late to close my Simple account before the transition, I was forcibly transitioned into a BBVA checking account. To say they botched the transition is an understatement. Their phone lines crashed, their web servers crashed, and they just generally did not care about their new customers during this time. Calling to close my account took 8 hours over three days in May 2021, and I come to find out now that it still isn’t closed! After calling to dispute the issue, the customer service agent (with a noticeable language barrier) was rude and told me, in effect, that I was out of luck, before hanging up on me. BBVA is just as bad as their new parent bank, PNC. They should be perfect for each other. Avoid at all costs.",
Brandon,14.07.2021,"Tulsa, OK",compass_bank,1,BBVA consolidated Simple and removed one of the greatest financial institutions ever offered to the public. Simple processed transactions immediately BBVA can take up to 5 days to process a transaction. Online banking is a joke. The website and app are a joke. I have had better luck using spreadsheet apps then any of the tools from BBVA. Last time I checked it was 2021 not 1980. Simple supplied tools to easily help you budget and maintain financial stability. BBVA has crippled millions financially and continues to be a failure of a institution. I will be finding a new bank as soon as possible. Worst bank I have ever done business with.,

It took them roughly 5 business days to clear. Luckily, I didn't really need it right away but on the day that it was supposed to clear there was nothing there. I called them and they said, ""Well it can clear at anytime up until midnight..."" Up until midnight. I've never heard of this. From any bank. Ever. Usually it's there first thing in the morning. It eventually cleared around 9pm that night. Again, I didn't really need it right away but it's just point of it. 5 days for 700 bucks then on the 5th day, ""Oh it can happen at any time up until midnight."" Seems pretty crappy to me.",2.0

The phone rep said someone would get back to me via email with the information I needed to submit to resolve the matter. No email ever came.

They explained that their online banking department makes these offers but BBVA Bank is unaware of these offers that their Marketing department advertises.

I then called Compass to ask if there was a problem with my card because for some reason it would not going through. They informed me that even though I had a $15,000 credit limit, I was not able to use more than $5000 a day.

Cortez,3.08.2018,"Tigard, OR",key_bank,1,"So I was thinking of possibly switching from Chase to Key Bank. I put a 50 dollar deposit in the Key Account that I opened online. The 50 dollars took a week to post to the account. I thought Key lost my money so I had Chase reverse the deposit. Key sent my account to fraud for closure without a call, email or text. Before it was closed I did a 1 dollar deposit for a test. Key Bank failed my test with flying colors. No word on the dollar I put in. I’m just happy I got my 50 back from Chase and I only lose a dollar for dealing with these fools. Do yourself a favor. Don’t deal with Key Bank at all if possible. If you do give them the bare minimum or you will regret it. They will lose your money in a heartbeat. I only had them for 10 days and it was 10 very bad days.

Key Bank does not offer any business loan that does not include an early payoff penalty and they do not disclose that until after they have tricked you into signing a contract.

Banked with them for 10 years. Personal, business, and even referred Key to my employees. About 10 accounts all together.

Teresa,11.05.2020,"Albuquerque, NM",crescent_bank_la,1,"I am a caregiver to a disabled Veteran (U.S Marines). This poor guy had a car loan through Crescent Bank. An inattentive driver totaled his vehicle on February 2, 2020. Although the other driver's insurance company has paid $19,351.48 on the car, and GAP has sent over $4,000.00 (when only $2,000+ was the left over balance), Crescent Bank has refused to relay this information to the credit bureaus. They told me directly that either I or the Veteran has to contact the credit bureaus to get the $31,000.00 balance removed from the credit bureau records.  And, why is $31,000.00 on the credit bureaus?? The payoff was just over $22,000.00, and has been paid by the insurance company and GAP!! In fact, Crescent Bank owes this disabled Vet the overage paid Crescent Bank by GAP!! With all of the horrible reviews here, as well as on the Better Business Bureau website, why has there been no change in this bank's business practices?? Why has there been no class action lawsuit against them?? As I am writing this, my disabled Veteran is filling out a request for review on National Consumer Law Center!! This disabled Vet cannot purchase another vehicle to get to his V.A. Doctor appointments, go shopping, etc., because Crescent Bank will not notify the credit bureau that he no longer owes them for the car! Legally, the insurance company for the driver who caused the accident, and GAP, have paid the amount legally owed on the totaled vehicle...so, why is Crescent Bank leaving $31,000 on the credit bureaus when the payoff of $22,000.00+ has been paid??? This is truly unconscionable!!! WHERE CAN THIS DISABLED MARINE GO FOR HELP? I am writing this review because I am handling all of the physical and financial affairs of this Veteran...he is so calm about this, yet I am dealing with the rude people at Crescent Bank and am really fed up!! HELP!!""",30.0

The experience with them has been the absolute worst. I would always pay my car earlier than the due date and plus extra but when I did and my payment came around, they said I was still late and that I had to make a payment which I didn’t understand. If I paid early why would I still owe for that month. Each time I did that I got late fees. I would have to call them each time I wanted to pay early so they would apply it for that month's payment so I wouldn’t be considered late.

I pay $500 a month (2x) for a total of $1000 a month. Basically I am 4-5 months ahead on my payments but they calculate daily interest from your payment date to you due date. so if I'm 4 months ahead that's 120days... ($1200 added interest.) When I called them out on this I was told that they are just the collection agency for my loan not the bank. I asked for the bank's info. I was told they didnt have it available.

Along with those communications, there were significant delays in response time (average 2 days at a time), and required me to follow up just to hear back.

They do not call back. They write an unprofessional letter from the Office of the President signed by a one name Mickey without any contact info. They uphold fraudulent bogus charges by a merchant claiming to have done work they did not do. Even when I provided proof of what work was to be done and it wasn't done they wanted me to go through an ordeal to prove the work wasn't done.

Jennie,14.07.2017,"Port Huron, MI",us_bank,1,I would like to share my experience with U.S. Bank ReliaCard with anyone that will listen. This card will steal your money. I return an item that I purchased from Amazon. Amazon returned my money to U.S. ReliaCard and U.S. ReliaCard did not give me my money. They actually made me file a dispute and now I have to wait 180 days for them to figure out if they're going to give me my money which is a refund from Amazon. I will not recommend sticking with this card at all as they will do anything they can to keep your money... Also had another experience where someone stole my bank card number. Not the actual physical card but just the number off of it. Also had to file another dispute for that. That took months and months to get my money back on that one.,5.0

Bottom line, unlike American Express who will send a letter asking the customer if they want to renew their card prior to billing you, US BANK charges you directly.

Chip,31.05.2022,"Alexandria, LA",regions_bank,1,"After ten years of difficult business with Regions, they’ve ruined my credit score over a $5 credit card balance when they stopped my auto pay for reasons they refuse to reveal. This card had been on autopay for several years since they finally began allowing autopay from external bank accounts. In Jan ‘22 I took a $5 Uber ride billed to Regions CC. I work out of town for months at a time, hence the need for autopay. Feb and March statements were missed as I was 1100 miles away. By the time I got home, my first clue there was a problem was a denied credit card application despite a credit score of 842/850. The reason was a current delinquent CC account. Long story short, 1st customer service said many people had their “external autopay” deleted and she didn’t know why. Complaint filed requesting credit correction. 6 weeks later no written letter as promised. ",6.0

Regions did absolutely nothing. My advice for you is to run from this bank fast. I will be closing all my account. They are not for the hard working consumer.,16.0

I have part of my check going there direct deposit. I also have a credit union that I bank with and they give me 250.00 free overdraft coverage long as I pay it back in 24 hrs so I HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you are not rich DO NOT BANK WITH REGIONS.

So I then asked could they resend the gift cards to the correct address and that say no. I also asked could I get my points back and they say no. That is so not fair. Totally frustrated with them. They didn't even try to accommodate a life long customer.,11.0

The bank also has a branch conveniently located 2 blocks away from the office I rented for my new business.

They’ve run out of money (that’s what the teller told me when coming to the bank for a withdrawal). The next closest branch was more than 30 mins away. Regions assessed an overdraft fee in anticipation of an overdraft. After waiting more than 20 mins to speak with someone on the phone, they say they can’t refund me because at midnight I had a transaction come in for the next day that “would’ve over drafted me” and that was their reasoning for taking $36 from me. It’s ridiculous! I’m going to a bank that has quality customer service and doesn’t want to take your hard earned money.",7.0

Charge the card up & do balance transfers. Then they allowed her to delete herself as an authorized user without ever contacting me once. Leaving me solely responsible for a credit card bill that someone else ran up. Then they would not give me a copy of the charges so I could personally go after the person that ACTUALLY ran the card up. I will continue to post this everywhere possible until I get my money back or they give me a copy of the charges!!!,12.0
Wendy,28.06.2017,"Mc Donald, TN",regions_bank,1,"We've never experienced such a lack of professionalism, courtesy, or ethics as we have in the past few months at the hands of Regions bank! After a banking relationship of over 20 years, an incompetent employee of an unrelated business from our personal accounts, created a nightmare situation, that has been completely resolved, however, Regions has basically said that they will supply us what we need to find another bank! Since that time we've been told by several other banks and accountants, that this is Regions' way of weeding out 'old money' to bring in new money. We've also been asked by so many businesses in our area as to why we're still with Regions, and now we know why! While you may be new money now, at some point you will be old money, and you will be kicked to the curb, no matter how much money you have!

I STILL haven't been approved and there is now even more paperwork that she wants. I'm trying to borrow 4% of my assets and I have no debt for my debt-to-income ratio. WHY IS IT TAKING SO LONG? I've never experienced a bank that was so determined to lose business.",2.0
Scott,2.08.2022,"Stanton, IA",flagstar,1,Since Flagstar purchased my mortage they have had 2 data breaches. The most recent breach I called with some specific questions and was told my questions would be passed on to the appropriate department and I would receive a return call. After 6 to 8 weeks this has not happened. I have sent several emails asking for a response with no replies. I have reached out on Facebook and Twitter. I have received acknowledgement but then it goes nowhere. Don't think for a minute this bank cares about you or your personal data. Customer service is nonexistent.,6.0
Ricky,2.08.2022,"Sulphur, LA",flagstar,1,This company is the absolute worse mortgage company to deal with. I have had mortgages with other banks and Flagstar by far is the most difficult to deal with. I had an insurance loss due to a fire and it was nearly impossible to get access to the funds in escrow once Flagstar received them. Because of the difficulties I decided to sell the home because of the drawn out process of dealing with Flagstar. I intended to use the escrow funds to pay the mortgage off so that I could be done with Flagstar and purchase another home. ,10.0
Jason,29.07.2022,"Hebron, IL",flagstar,1,On 6/15 a storm came through my area and blew a portion of my roof off. On 6/16 I called my insurance provider and they advised me to let my mortgage company know about the damages. That same day I called Flagstar and went through their automated claim line and got my claim number (or whatever they call it). I stayed on the line to make sure I could talk to a person about what I had to do next. A nice lady picked up and told me that their systems were down and she couldn't only give some general information. She told me once I get my check from my insurance company that I needed to write the Flag Star claim number on the check and mail it to them in Arizona along with the estimate from the contractor and any paperwork from my insurance company. I followed her instructions and mailed all documents to Flag Star as soon as the check came through on 7/11. ,6.0

This year 2022 and last year 2021 they didn't take enough money for the tax/escrow and also sent too much money back to me in an overage check.

Devon,28.06.2022,"Tiverton, RI",flagstar,1,"Awful company, not only have they had 2 data breaches they also messed up my taxes for last year because of their lack of due diligence and now they are trying to make me pay for the difference. The customer service not only was rude and yelled but also insisted they contacted the town and the total received was correct and that I am wrong. However, I have the proof that they did not do their due diligence and made an error causing my escrow go to zero. Now they expect me to pay much more every month. Keep in mind I’ve never missed a payment and pay 2 months ahead of time. The tax that they insist was given to them by the town in 2021 was not even close. It hasn’t nearly been that low for years and they would of notice that if they actually did their part. Now they expect me to pay the difference. I don’t miss a payment and pay on time 100% of the time but I’m getting penalized for their error. That’s ridiculous!",4.0

They told me that autopay had been cancelled but could not tell me why (this was not something I had done). They told me I needed to make a payment. I made a payment and they double charged me. I called back and they refused to reverse the charges.

Lauren,26.05.2022,"Norwalk, CT",flagstar,1,"UWM sold my loan to this train wreck of a bank, and within the first few days they have already majorly screwed up my payment. Flagstar's web UI is atrocious. I navigated to the payments page, selected 'additional principal' and made an additional principal payment. Flagstar's system then reversed my payment and applied it as a regular monthly payment, rather than an additional principal. This is very clearly not what I selected. If a user specifically goes out of their way to select a principal only payment, especially after the monthly payment has been made, it should not be reversed. If people select this option by mistake, then you need to generate a warning modal to prompt the user to either confirm and continue, or cancel. What a terrible user experience.",4.0

We dealt with that, however it is now over 2 weeks since taxes were due and I still have no form.
